## Install

Install our Python SDK using [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk
```

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

Initialize the Python SDK with the Django integration in your `settings.py` file. Once this is done, the SDK captures all unhandled exceptions and transactions.

settings.py

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.django import DjangoIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0",
    integrations=[DjangoIntegration()],

    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production,
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,

    # If you wish to associate users to errors (assuming you are using
    # django.contrib.auth) you may enable sending PII data.
    send_default_pii=True
)
```

Additional configuration for `DjangoIntegration` can be found under [integration configuration](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/guides/django/configuration/integrations/django/).

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up:

```python
from django.urls import path

def trigger_error(request):
    division_by_zero = 1 / 0

urlpatterns = [
    path('sentry-debug/', trigger_error),
    # ...
]
```
