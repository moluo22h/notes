#### Actions

Actions的分类：

- **Disruptive actions** \- Cause ModSecurity to do something. In many cases something means block transaction, but not in all. For example, the allow action is classified as a disruptive action, but it does the opposite of blocking. There can only be one disruptive action per rule (if there are multiple disruptive actions present, or inherited, only the last one will take effect), or rule chain (in a chain, a disruptive action can only appear in the first rule).

  > Note :**Disruptive actions will NOT be executed if the SecRuleEngine is set to DetectionOnly**. If you are creating exception/whitelisting rules that use the allow action, you should also add the ctl:ruleEngine=On action to execute the action.

- **Non-disruptive action**s - Do something, but that something does not and cannot affect the rule processing flow. Setting a variable, or changing its value is an example of a non-disruptive action. Non-disruptive action can appear in any rule, including each rule belonging to a chain.

- **Flow actions** - These actions affect the rule flow (for example skip or skipAfter).

- **Meta-data actions** - Meta-data actions are used to provide more information about rules. Examples include id, rev, severity and msg.

- **Data actions** - Not really actions, these are mere containers that hold data used by other actions. For example, the status action holds the status that will be used for blocking (if it takes place).

- tag: https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual-(v2.x)#tag

#### Transformation Functions

*Warning : It is currently possible to use SecDefaultAction to specify a default list of transformation functions, which will be applied to all rules that follow the SecDefaultAction directive. However, this practice is not recommended, because it means that mistakes are very easy to make. It is recommended that you always specify the transformation functions that are needed by a particular rule, starting the list with t:none (which clears the possibly inherited transformation functions).*



- lowercase

#### Phases

- phase:2 - Request body stage
- phase:3 - Response headers stage
- phase:4 - Response body stage



- Logging (LOGGING)

#### 自定义规则

If you create your own custom rules that you would like to use with the Core rules, you should create a file called - modsecurity_crs_15_customrules.conf and place it in the same directory as the Core rules files. By using this file name, your custom rules will be called up after the standard ModSecurity Core rules configuration file but before the other Core rules. This allows your rules to be evaluated first which can be useful if you need to implement specific "allow" rules or to correct any false positives in the Core rules as they are applied to your site.
